# Note: 'try-start' and 'try-stop' commands would be better than this
# "2>/dev/null || true" hack used below. Then we could distinguish "already
# did that" from "something went wrong."

# Reminder: The pipe character ("|") in a list of prerequesites separates the
# _normal_ prerequisites from the _order-only_ prerequisites. For dependencies
# on installable system utilities, we want _order-only_ prerequisites. Those
# are made if they're absent, but their modification time is not taken to
# account subsequently. Also, remaking them doesn't remake their dependents.
